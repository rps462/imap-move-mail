IMAPMoveMail - Ryan Smith

The purpose of this script is mainly for retrieving FBL (Feedback Loop) messages
from one or more IMAP account(s) and sending them to another email account via 
smtp socket, all at once in one session.

Typically, the email address we're sending these to will have the ability to 
parse these messages out and take action on them to update spam filters. 

You'll need to modify the initial variables, and include the IMAP accounts being
checked with the format specified in the script. 

** The php-imap extension is needed for this script to function properly. **
